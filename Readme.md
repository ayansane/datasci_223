# Data Science 223
## Applied Data Science With Python
---

### Introduction

My name is Alfa Yansane. I am a public health researcher. Within this course, I want to continue my practice of Data Science fundamentals in the Python language.

### Collaborators
Alfa Yansane

### Instructions
The code is in a Jupyter notebook format where each code block can be executed in top to bottom order. The entire Juptyer notebook can also be executed by using the drop- down menus.

### Installations
1. _Exercise 1 Note_ - The typing library was used to report the data types of both function parameters and and return values. Its usage is as follows:
```python
from typing import List
```

2. _Exercise 2 Note_ - The enmist, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, string, and hashlib libraries. Usage is as follows:
```
import string
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import emnist
from hashlib import sha1
```

3. _Exercise 3 Note_ - The following libraries were imported:
```
# Load chinook dataset and query it using SQL magic into pandas dataframes
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import sqlite3
%load_ext sql
```

### Difficulties
1. _Exercise 1 Note_ - No difficulties to report.
2. _Exercise 2 Note_ - The code written for creating nan's did not run for me and I could not figure out how to get it to work.
3. _Exercise 3 Note_ - No difficulties to report
